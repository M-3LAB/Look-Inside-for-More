# Overview
This is the Reproducible Realisation of the AAAI25 paper ["Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13461). 

üò≠ Because of a server storage disaster, our initial version of the code was lost, however, thanks to the help of some researchers, we have reproduced an approximation of the code for this paper. If you have a better reproduction, please get in touch with us at 2023362051@email.szu.edu.cn.

üòä code1 represents a fast version and code2 represents a more performant version. Note that the code2 implementation seems to perform better than our official implementation, but their implementation is not the same as the storage the authors remember. There may have some bugs the author dose not find, please tell us.

## Before that, a few caveats:

üöÄOur code implementation is based on the Nips23 paper "Real3D-AD: A Dataset of Point Cloud Anomaly Detection" and we thank them for their work!

üöÄSimilar to their work, our code is also stochastic, and the results in the paper are obtained by means of the mean. If there are some discrepancies between your implementation and the values in the paper, it may be due to randomness and we are working on addressing it. To try to be as consistent as possible, you can use either the RTX3090 (24GB) mentioned in the paper or the A100 (40GB) from when we published the code.

## Data and Checkpoints

Please download the [Real3D-AD dataset](https://github.com/M-3LAB/Real3D-AD?tab=readme-ov-file) and place it in the directory ```data/ ```.

Please download the [PointMAE checkpoints](https://github.com/Pang-Yatian/Point-MAE/releases/download/main/pretrain.pth) and place it in the directory ```checkpoints/```.

## Our Environment, Training, and Evaluation
We implement benchmarks under CUDA 11.3 The following command can reproduce our environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
pip install "git+git://github.com/erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch.git#egg=pointnet2_ops&subdirectory=pointnet2_ops_lib"
```
### how to train and evaluate code 1?

Run it:

```bash
python3 main.py --gpu 0 --seed 42 --memory_size 10000 --anomaly_scorer_num_nn 3 --faiss_on_gpu --faiss_num_workers 8 sampler -p 0.1 approx_greedy_corest #eval on Real3D-AD
```

### how to train and evaluate code 2?
V1.1(A version that works, but at a reduced speed)
Run it:

```bash
python3 main.py \
  --gpu 0 \
  --seed 42 \
  --memory_size 10000 \
  --anomaly_scorer_num_nn 3 \
  --class_name seahorse \
  --faiss_on_gpu \
  --faiss_num_workers 8 \
  sampler -p 0.1 approx_greedy_coreset
# take seahorse for example 
```

V1.0(There are some problems in Memory Out of Bounds)
First, you need to open the file:```root/miniconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/faiss/__init__.py```. Then, replace this file with the```__init__.py``` our provided.

Run it:

```bash
python3 main.py --gpu 0 --seed 42 --memory_size 10000 --anomaly_scorer_num_nn 3 --faiss_on_gpu --faiss_num_workers 8 sampler -p 0.1 approx_greedy_corest #eval on Real3D-AD
```

# Please Note
Other researchers submitted our code and is missing some of the implementations. code1 is efficient but not very performant, code2 achieves some of the better performance but is slower, and we welcome new submissions that exceed the level in the paper.
