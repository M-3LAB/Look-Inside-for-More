# Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection
This is the official implementation of the AAAI25 paper "Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection"[https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13461]. We will publish the implementation of the relevant model here. Due to the maintainer schedule, the release time will be after the conference, if you have any questions before then, please contact us at 2023362051@email.szu.edu.cn

## Before that, a few caveats:

Our code implementation is based on the Nips23 paper "Real3D-AD: A Dataset of Point Cloud Anomaly Detection" and we thank them for their work!

Similar to their work, our code is also stochastic, and the results in the paper are obtained by means of the mean. If there are some discrepancies between your implementation and the values in the paper, it may be due to randomness and we are working on addressing it. To try to be as consistent as possible, you can use either the RTX3090 (24GB) graphics card mentioned in the paper or the A100 (40GB) graphics card from when we declassied the code.
